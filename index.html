          <div id = "half_2">
            <p> We are Team Eggheads, a team of four mechanical engineering students
              at University of California, Berkeley. Our semester project is an egg peeler that
              aims to extract the hard boiled egg from its eggshell automatically.
              We believe that there is a demand for a more convenient way of peeling
              hard boiled eggs as it is widely applicable in many restaurants
              and there is no standard egg peeler machine available in the market.
              The main goal of this project, then, is to create a machine that can efficiently
              peel eggs with minimal human effort. </p>
              <p>
              Cooking hard boiled eggs involves the need to set the timer and peel the eggs by hand,
              which are menial and irritating tasks if you are working in a busy kitchen.
              By using an air compressor and tight sealing, our project aims to significantly reduce the
              time and effort that goes into cooking hard boiled eggs by creating a reliable,
              fully-automated egg peeler.
