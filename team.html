              <h2> Whi-Il Kim </h2>
              <p> 	I am an international student from South Korea.
                At UC Berkeley, I have been studying mechanical engineering and physics,
                and Iâ€™ve loved it so far. My main interests include combustion, waves, and aerodynamics.
                Most importantly, my favorite egg dish is an omelette! </p>

            <h2> Eugene Lim </h2>
            <p> I am a senior studying mechanical engineering, and my main interests lie in design and aerodynamics.
              My favorite egg dish is a good, old-fashioned hard boiled egg.

            <h2> Peter Park </h2>
           <p> I am a senior at Cal studying mechanical engineering and will graduate this December.
             During my time at Cal I have been interested in biomechanics as well as design.
             After graduation, I will be working in the industry and would like to return to school to get my Masters degree.
             I love eggs benedict!</p> </span>

            <h2> Vedang Patankar </h2>
            <p> I am a senior studying mechanical engineering, and I'm interested in fluid mechanics and
            applications, particularly in the fields of fluid-structure interaction and microscale flows.
            I hope to continue for a graduate education. My favorite egg dish is a classic scrambled eggs. </p>
